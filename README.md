## Add your own integration

Want to create an integration or improve an existing one? Awesome! Adding an integration is super easy. You need basic web programming skills (HTML, Javascript, Git) and can be done in a couple of hours.

Just fork the repo, make your changes, and send us a pull request. 

## Something needs fixing?

[Create an issue](https://github.com/clockify/browser-extension/issues) here on Github and our team will take a look the first change we get (which may take a few days, depending on our workload).

If you need the fix quicker, feel free to update the integration yourself and send us a pull request. We typically take care of them within a few days.



## Building and testing

### Chrome extension

1. Make sure you have Node, NPM, Ruby, and Compass installed on your system (see setup instructions below)
2. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:clockify/browser-extension.git`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Build Chrome extension by running:<br>
 Linux: `npm run compile.dev.chrome`<br>
 Windows: `npm run compile.dev.chrome.win`
5. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
6. Enable "Developer mode" (located in the top right corner)
7. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `www/chrome.dev/` folder that you've built


### Firefox extension

1. Make sure you have Node, NPM, Ruby, and Compass installed on your system (see setup instructions below)
2. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:clockify/browser-extension.git`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Build Firefox add-on by running:<br>
Linux: `npm run compile.dev.firefox`<br>
Windows: `npm run compile.dev.firefox.win`

5. Navigate to `about:debugging`
6. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
7. Select the `www/firefox.dev/manifest.json` file

### How adding an integration works

Add the url of the new tool in `/src/integrations/integrations.json`. Then, create a `/src/integrations/myapp.js` file. It in, define where the button appears and from which element it needs to pick up the description field. 

When the extension recognizes that you're on that url, it will load the necessary script. 

If you need an example, you can see how [Trello](/src/integrations/trello.js) is implemented.

Use `createButton()` so both the icon and "Start timer" is displayed. If there's not enough space, you can use `createSmallButton` (so only the icon is displayed).

Before sending us a pull request, make sure you test the integration in both Chrome and Firefox.
