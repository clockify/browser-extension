## Something needs fixing?

[Create an issue](https://github.com/clockify/browser-extension/issues) here on Github.

Our team will take a look once we get the chance, but that may take a few weeks or more (depending on our workload). 

If you need the fix quicker, feel free to update the integration yourself and send us a pull request. We typically take care of them within a few days, meaning your fix can sometimes go live within the same week.

4. Type `xpinstall.signatures.required` and chenge to `false`
5. Go to `about:addons` and click `Install addons from file`, choose file `*.xpi`


### Adding a new tool

Add the url of the new tool in `/src/integrations/integrations.json`. Then, create a `/src/integrations/myapp.js` file. It in, define where the button appears and from which element it needs to pick up the description field. 

When the extension recognizes that you're on that url, it will load the necessary script. 

If you need an example, you can see how [Trello](/src/integrations/trello.js) is implemented.

Use `createButton()` so both the icon and "Start timer" is displayed. If there's not enough space, you can use `createSmallButton` (so only the icon is displayed).

Before sending us a pull request, make sure you test it in both Chrome and Firefox.
